# ACNLWA-Decomp

Experimental decompilation and unofficial reverse-engineering effort for (parts of) //Animal Crossing: New Leaf — Welcome amiibo//, mainly to facilitate modding. Any kind of help with doing the work is welcome, since we don't have a lot of reverse-engineering experience and are only learning as we go!
