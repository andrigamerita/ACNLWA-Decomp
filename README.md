# ACNLWA-Decomp

Experimental decompilation and unofficial reverse-engineering effort for (parts of) _Animal Crossing: New Leaf — Welcome amiibo_, mainly to facilitate modding. Any kind of help with doing the work is welcome, since we don't have a lot of reverse-engineering experience and are only learning as we go!

We are basing our work on the following releases:

* Title ID `0004000000198F00`, Product Code `CTR-P-EAAP`, Version 5.0.0 (5120)
    * `dbea4668a5d4dd04a6d11661ae4262db` Animal Crossing - New Leaf - Welcome Amiibo (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).3ds
